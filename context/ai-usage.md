// AI-generated: Documentation of AI usage for the project

# AI Usage Summary

This module was built 100% with AI in Cursor. AI drove planning, coding, refactoring, and UI polish. Human effort focused on directing goals and validating results on device/emulator.

## Tools
- Cursor (chat-driven code edits, semantic search, file diffs)
- GPT-5 assistant & Claude 4.

## How AI Was Used
- Generated the initial Clean Architecture scaffold (`app`, `domain`, `data`, `common`)
- Implemented Room entities/DAOs, Hilt modules, repository impl, and mappers
- Built Compose screens and ViewModels with `StateFlow` UI states
- Added validation, loading/empty states, grouping and filters
- Integrated receipt image flow (pick, cache, preview) and list thumbnails
- Iteratively cleaned theme usage for accessibility in light mode
- Simplified filter dialogs to Material surfaces and text buttons
- Reorganized Expenses header for better fit on small widths

## Prompts & Iterations
Representative prompts are captured in `context/execution/prompts.md`. Highlights include:
- Align Expenses screen styles with Add Expense
- Remove FAB, simplify Reports app bar, and remove export/share
- Add receipt image support and show thumbnails in the list
- Clean up date/category/grouping dialogs to non-gradient Material style

## Rationale for `context/` folder
- `requirements/original_requirements.md` anchored scope and acceptance criteria
- `docs/architecture.md` recorded module-level decisions
- `execution/tasks.md` and `implementation.md` tracked step-by-step execution and deltas
- `execution/prompts.md` stores key AI prompts used to generate edits
- This `ai-usage.md` provides the submission-ready AI usage summary

## Limitations / Next Steps
- Export/share is optional per spec and currently disabled
- Receipt files are stored in cache; move to `filesDir` for persistence across cache clears if needed



## 2025-08-09 Documentation Update
- Refreshed root `README.md`: removed ASCII block, added badges, Quickstart, corrected Gradle tasks, clarified signing/testing, and screenshot placeholders.
- Purpose: Improve clarity, skimmability, and professionalism based on user feedback that README felt bland.
- Affected files: `README.md` only.
- Review: Ensure links/commands reflect current Gradle modules; verify min/target SDK badges match `app/build.gradle.kts`.
