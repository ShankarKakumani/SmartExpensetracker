## App Overview
Modern expense tracking app built with Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, Hilt, and Room. Designed end‚Äëto‚Äëend in Cursor with an AI‚Äëfirst workflow and documented under `context/`.
It enables quick expense entry, powerful filtering, and simple weekly insights‚Äîall fully offline with optional persistence.

[![Download APK](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-APK%20v1.0-228B22?style=for-the-badge&logo=android)](https://github.com/ShankarKakumani/SmartExpensetracker/releases/download/v1.0/app-release.apk)

APK: Ready to install directly on your Android device. Download and install the `app-release.apk`.

## AI Usage Summary
Built in an AI‚Äëfirst workflow using Cursor with ChatGPT to scaffold modules (ViewModels, repositories, Room entities/DAOs), generate Compose UI, and refine UX copy/validation.
Copilot assisted with boilerplate and quick refactors, while iterative prompts guided architecture decisions and navigation/state handling.
All key prompts, retries, and decisions are logged under `context/` for transparency and reproducibility.

## Prompt Logs (Key Prompts)
> Plan Clean Architecture and module boundaries for SmartExpensetracker; mirror patterns from JarOnboardingAnimation.

> Scaffold ExpenseEntryViewModel with StateFlow, validation (title non‚Äëempty, amount > 0), and addExpense handler.

> Compose UI for ExpenseListScreen with date/category filters, grouping toggle, empty/loading states.

> Create Room entities/DAO for expenses and mappers between domain/data layers.

Comprehensive logs: see `context/execution/prompts.md`.

## Checklist of Features Implemented
- [x] Expense Entry: title, amount, category (Staff, Travel, Food, Utility), optional notes, optional receipt image (cached; path saved in Room)
- [x] Real‚Äëtime ‚ÄúTotal Spent Today‚Äù summary with validation
- [x] Expense List: today by default, date/category filters, grouping (none/category/date), search, empty and loading states
- [x] Reports: last 7 days analytics with daily totals, category breakdown, bar chart
- [x] Theming: Material 3 with light/dark support
- [ ] Export/Share from Reports (optional in spec; currently not enabled)

## Screens
- Add Expense (`ExpenseEntryScreen`)
- Expenses (`ExpenseListScreen`)
- Reports (`ExpenseReportScreen`)

## Architecture
- Clean Architecture (modules: `app`, `domain`, `data`, `common`)
- State‚Äëdriven UI with `StateFlow` ViewModels per screen
- Hilt DI modules for repositories, data sources, Room database
- Room for local persistence (`ExpenseEntity`, `ExpenseDao`, `SmartExpenseDatabase`)
- Mappers converting between domain and data models

## Data Model
- Domain `Expense` includes: `title`, `amount`, `category`, `notes?`, `receiptImageUrl?`, `timestamp`
- Receipt images are copied to app `cacheDir` and previewed immediately; cached file path is saved to Room for retrieval

## UX Notes
- Material 3 color scheme and typography for contrast in light/dark
- Dialogs (date/category/grouping) use clean surfaces and text buttons
- Search bar, chips, and cards follow Material guidance

## Quickstart
Prereqs: JDK 11+, Android Studio (latest), Android SDKs.

Build & install debug:

```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

Run unit tests:

```
./gradlew test
```

Run instrumentation tests (device/emulator required):

```
./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest
```

Build release APK:

```
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

APK output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

Signing (release): configure `signing.properties` at project root:

```
storeFile=keystore/release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=...
keyPassword=...
```

Default values are provided for local builds. Replace with your own keystore for distribution.

## Testing
- Test scaffolds live in `app/src/androidTest` and `app/src/test`.
- Suggested tasks: `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest`.

## AI‚ÄëFirst Development in Cursor
This project was created with AI assistance in Cursor. The `context/` folder documents the process:
- `context/requirements/original_requirements.md`: authoritative scope and acceptance criteria
- `context/docs/architecture.md`: architecture decisions
- `context/execution/tasks.md` and `implementation.md`: step‚Äëby‚Äëstep execution log
- `context/execution/prompts.md`: representative prompts
- `context/ai-usage.md`: summary of AI usage

Workflow notes:
- Iterative edits generated by AI in Cursor
- UI/UX refinements (contrast, dialog clean‚Äëup, header layout) evaluated live on device
- Repository, Room entities/DAOs, DI modules, and ViewModels scaffolded and refined by AI

## Folder Structure
```
SmartExpensetracker/
  app/        # Compose UI + ViewModels + navigation
  domain/     # Use cases, domain models, repository interfaces
  data/       # Room DB, DAOs, data sources, repository impl, mappers
  common/     # Shared utilities and base constructs
  context/    # Requirements, architecture notes, AI usage & prompts
```

## Notes & Limitations
- Export/share from Reports is optional in the spec and currently disabled
- Receipt images are stored in cache; clearing app cache removes files (the DB path remains). Switch to `filesDir/receipts` if persistence across cache clears is required
