Modern expense tracking app built with Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture, Hilt, and Room. Designed end‑to‑end in Cursor with an AI‑first workflow and documented under `context/`.

## Features
- Expense Entry: title, amount, category (Staff, Travel, Food, Utility), optional notes, optional receipt image (cached; path saved in Room)
- Real‑time “Total Spent Today” summary with validation
- Expense List: today by default, date/category filters, grouping (none/category/date), search, empty and loading states
- Reports: last 7 days analytics with daily totals, category breakdown, bar chart
- Theming: Material 3 with light/dark support

## Screens
- Add Expense (`ExpenseEntryScreen`)
- Expenses (`ExpenseListScreen`)
- Reports (`ExpenseReportScreen`)

## Architecture
- Clean Architecture (modules: `app`, `domain`, `data`, `common`)
- State‑driven UI with `StateFlow` ViewModels per screen
- Hilt DI modules for repositories, data sources, Room database
- Room for local persistence (`ExpenseEntity`, `ExpenseDao`, `SmartExpenseDatabase`)
- Mappers converting between domain and data models

## Data Model
- Domain `Expense` includes: `title`, `amount`, `category`, `notes?`, `receiptImageUrl?`, `timestamp`
- Receipt images are copied to app `cacheDir` and previewed immediately; cached file path is saved to Room for retrieval

## UX Notes
- Material 3 color scheme and typography for contrast in light/dark
- Dialogs (date/category/grouping) use clean surfaces and text buttons
- Search bar, chips, and cards follow Material guidance

## Quickstart
Prereqs: JDK 11+, Android Studio (latest), Android SDKs.

Build & install debug:

```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

Run unit tests:

```
./gradlew test
```

Run instrumentation tests (device/emulator required):

```
./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest
```

Build release APK:

```
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

APK output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

Signing (release): configure `signing.properties` at project root:

```
storeFile=keystore/release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=...
keyPassword=...
```

Default values are provided for local builds. Replace with your own keystore for distribution.

## Testing
- Test scaffolds live in `app/src/androidTest` and `app/src/test`.
- Suggested tasks: `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew :app:connectedAndroidTest`.

## AI‑First Development in Cursor
This project was created with AI assistance in Cursor. The `context/` folder documents the process:
- `context/requirements/original_requirements.md`: authoritative scope and acceptance criteria
- `context/docs/architecture.md`: architecture decisions
- `context/execution/tasks.md` and `implementation.md`: step‑by‑step execution log
- `context/execution/prompts.md`: representative prompts
- `context/ai-usage.md`: summary of AI usage

Workflow notes:
- Iterative edits generated by AI in Cursor
- UI/UX refinements (contrast, dialog clean‑up, header layout) evaluated live on device
- Repository, Room entities/DAOs, DI modules, and ViewModels scaffolded and refined by AI

## Folder Structure
```
SmartExpensetracker/
  app/        # Compose UI + ViewModels + navigation
  domain/     # Use cases, domain models, repository interfaces
  data/       # Room DB, DAOs, data sources, repository impl, mappers
  common/     # Shared utilities and base constructs
  context/    # Requirements, architecture notes, AI usage & prompts
```

## Notes & Limitations
- Export/share from Reports is optional in the spec and currently disabled
- Receipt images are stored in cache; clearing app cache removes files (the DB path remains). Switch to `filesDir/receipts` if persistence across cache clears is required
